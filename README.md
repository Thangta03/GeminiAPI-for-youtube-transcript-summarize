1, fix to only save the .txt
2, now need to use Gemini API to summarize

7/5/2024
Update: 
1, Can use YoutubeAPI to get transcript only of the video
2, Can get name, language, translated script, thumbnail of the video
3, Can use Gemini API to summarize short text
4, Video transcript is way too long (norm >20000 characters/words) > study from Langchain to split the text file to smaller trunk to summarize, but struggle to keep the coherence, may need fine-tuning
5, Try to use Github Copilot Workspace
